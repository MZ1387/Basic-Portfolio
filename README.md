# HW_Basic-Portfolio

In this assignment, I built a basic portfolio site using HTML/CSS.

## Requirements

1. create the following: 

  * 3 HTML documents: `index.html`, `contact.html` and `portfolio.html`.
  * A folder called `assets`.
  * Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.
  * In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
  * In the `images` folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image, the placeholder images for the portfolio, and the social icon images).

2. The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**. 

  * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
  * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name is&mdash;that is fine and expected.
  * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.
  
  ### Additional Specifcations
  
1. Colors *Pro-tip: Use the [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages.*
    * Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): `#4aaaa5`
    * Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): `#777777`
    * Main header background color: `#ffffff`
    * Main header border color: `#cccccc`
    * Footer background color: `#666666`
    * Main content background color: `#ffffff`
    * Main content border color: `#dddddd`

2. Fonts:
    * For heading fonts use `font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;`.
    * For all other fonts use `'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;`.

3. Profile Image Found on `index.html`:
    * Use a picture of yourself. 
    * If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

4. Portfolio Images:
    * Placeholder images can be found at [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). 
    * Save the images to your `images` folder.

5. Social Link Images (Github, LinkedIn,  StackOverflow, etc.):
    * These images can be found on [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/).
    * Save the images to your `images` folder.
    * Ensure that these icons are live links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow profiles.

6. Background Images:
    + The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

7. Dimensions:
    * The entire content area is `960px` wide.
    * The main section content is `650px` wide.
    * The sidebar is `270px` wide.
    * Pro-tip: Use the [Page Ruler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-ruler/jlpkojjdgbllmedoapgfodplfhcbnbpn/related?hl=en) extension to measure the size of elements.
